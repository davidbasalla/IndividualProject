HIGH PRIORITY:

- implement annotation!!! SEE BELOW
- hook up mouse keys in Chrome
- talk to Ben Glocker about color lookups, when brightness is being applied
- talk to James Booth about annotation software



LOW PRIORITY:

- make custom slider for brightness/threshold
- work on providing online sample files
- add navigation panel feedback (for setting camera specifically)
- work on brightness!
- Protect against no WebGL
- Implement testing!!! Coverage etc
- Sort of errorhandler in XtkView



ANNOTATIONS:
------------

- decide on format - XML

Plan:
	1.)
	- create a dummy file with a sample cube and label
	- create temp interface to load annotation file
	- load and view this file in the viewer

	- loader
	  - use loader, read XML as string, then do stuff with it
	    (DONE)

	  - renderer, now ready to interpret the annotation
	  - need to translate the points into WORLD SPACE?
	  - investigate!








====================================================================================

DONE:
-----
- work on brightness!
- Fix Layout Swapping
- Cap indices when middle-mouse scrolling
- Fixed a redundancy in the code re update function, was being called
- multiple times!
- WHEN DELETING LAYER, FOCUS BACK ON THE FIRST ONE
- fix overlay (file undefined)
- fix levels sliders
- fix scroll behaviour when no valid items are set!
- add textEdit field for selectedIndex
- add in correction for input fields in Levels (for wrong inputs)
- Fix Buffer selection
- separate out 2D and 3DCanvasViewer	
- Restore 3D Functionality (pan/zoom/rotate)
- Volume Rendering done



NEXT STEPS:
-----------

- Add warning window when not able to load file
  - COMPLEX, LEAVE THIS SHIT TIL LATER, NEED TO DEBUG THOROUGHLY
  - should I only support NII for now?
  - Test script
      - would need a file loader
      - would need the whole loading malarchy


  
    


- Build custom slider to slider around for window level and threshold

- Work on overlaying of label maps

- Tutorials? Guide?





CBB's:
------

- Revise interaction of panels, bring up to XTK-style quality!
