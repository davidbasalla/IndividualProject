TODAY:

- Colortables:
  - problematic
      - XTK does not support applying ColorTable to loaded file
      - XTK only supports ColorTables for labelmaps
      -	have managed to apply color lookup to one slice only, need to
        delve deeper

      - also application of colormaps happens at the beginning when
        parsing the file structure, so not clear how interactive the
	swapping of files would be... NEED TO TEST

	Next steps:
	- get colorTables working for actual files
	- talk to Ben about importance of this feature
	- requires separate loading of these maps?
	- need to fully understand the flow of control of Xtk
	  
    
     


WIP:

- add different lookups
- work on refining the layout
	- make canvas fit inside the canv panel!!
	- fix resizing!




--------------------------------------

- work on implementing lookups!
    - for viewer or for layer
    - for viewer more desirable!

- work on providing online sample files

- add navigation panel feedback


---------------------------------------


- add extra controls
    - pan (2D)
    - zoom (2D)
    - shift control to control other slices!

PAN:
    - simlulate a mouse click on the xtk canvas element... 
    - alter the volume's data directly... prefered!
-----------------------------------------------------------


NEXT STEPS:
----------

- Fix Layout Swapping
   - SHIT.. when changing index to watch from, there's a problem as one XtkViewer has 2 different sizes
    - one way around is to use SliceDrop style selection of layout,
   - means swap with viewer.
     - when selecting, find which is the complementary viewer

- WHEN DELETING LAYER, FOCUS BACK ON THE FIRST ONE (currently no image)

- fix brightness!

- Restore 3D Functionality
    - navigation
    - volume rendering
    - separate panel?

- Cap indices when middle-mouse scrolling
- Investigate why Chrome not supporting WebGL

- Add warning window when not able to load file

- Polish Lookup Behaviour (tricky!)

- Build custom slider to slider around for window level and threshold
- Work on overlaying of label maps

- Bring whole project online
    - Support usage of custom data

- Tutorials? Guide?
