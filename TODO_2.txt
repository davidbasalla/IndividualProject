TODAY:

- Colortables:
  - problematic
      - XTK does not support applying ColorTable to loaded file
      - XTK only supports ColorTables for labelmaps
      -	have managed to apply color lookup to one slice only, need to
        delve deeper

      - also application of colormaps happens at the beginning when
        parsing the file structure, so not clear how interactive the
	swapping of files would be... NEED TO TEST

	Next steps:
	- get colorTables working for actual files
	- talk to Ben about importance of this feature
	- requires separate loading of these maps?
	- need to fully understand the flow of control of Xtk
	  
    
     


WIP:

- add different lookups
- work on refining the layout
	- make canvas fit inside the canv panel!!
	- fix resizing!




--------------------------------------

- work on implementing lookups!
    - for viewer or for layer
    - for viewer more desirable!

- work on providing online sample files

- add navigation panel feedback


---------------------------------------


- add extra controls
    - pan (2D)
    - zoom (2D)
    - shift control to control other slices!

PAN:
    - simlulate a mouse click on the xtk canvas element... 
    - alter the volume's data directly... prefered!
-----------------------------------------------------------

DONE:
-----

- Fix Layout Swapping
- Cap indices when middle-mouse scrolling
- Fixed a redundancy in the code re update function, was being called
- multiple times!
- WHEN DELETING LAYER, FOCUS BACK ON THE FIRST ONE
- fix overlay (file undefined)
- fix levels sliders
- fix scroll behaviour when no valid items are set!
- add textEdit field for selectedIndex
- add in correction for input fields in Levels (for wrong inputs)
- Fix Buffer selection
- separate out 2D and 3DCanvasViewer	
- Restore 3D Functionality (pan/zoom/rotate)
- Volume Rendering done



NEXT STEPS:
-----------

- Investigate why Chrome not supporting WebGL
  - seems to work fine on visual09 (lab machine)

- Add warning window when not able to load file
  - COMPLEX, LEAVE THIS SHIT TIL LATER, NEED TO DEBUG THOROUGHLY
  - should I only support NII for now?
  - Test script
      - would need a file loader
      - would need the whole loading malarchy

- Lookup Behaviour
  - create more colortables
  - store colortables so they can be accessed
    - look into same origin policy/load local files/need to be in txt
      format
  - figure out how to reload image
  
- Fix brightness for 2D renderers!
  
    


- Build custom slider to slider around for window level and threshold

- Work on overlaying of label maps

- Bring whole project online
    - Support usage of custom data

- Tutorials? Guide?

- MAKE SURE COMMANDS WORK IN CHROME ALSO!




CBB's:
------

- Revise interaction of panels, bring up to XTK-style quality!
