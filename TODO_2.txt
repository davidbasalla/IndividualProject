TODO:
-----


HIGH PRIORITY:

- talk to Ben about ColorLookups
- talk to Ben about Annotations

- WORK ON SMOOTHER INTERACTION - MOUSE-BASED... currently very slow, 
  compared to XTK navigation - seems to be down to how many times the
  screen is updated
- FIX THE AUTOSCALING WHEN SWITCHING VIEWS
- COUNTERACT LAYOUT SCALING OF ELEMENTS (LAYERS/ANNOS) - Have layout
  options?
  - needs to have a scroll bar at the right
- WORK ON LAYOUT
- Implement correct mouse movement when panning in CanvasViewer2D
- Protect against multiple file inputs on all inputs!
- CHECK WHY COLORLOOKUP DOESNT WORK ON NRRD FROM ONLINE
- Fix the -1 index in Levels, use the max numbers from volume!
- Figure out bug with low level brightness for JET map and NRRD
- ADD LOCK/UNLOCK OPTION TO INDECES!


LOW PRIORITY

- Tutorials? Guide?
- create hotkeys for everything?
- make custom slider for brightness/threshold
- work on providing online sample files
- add navigation panel feedback (for setting camera specifically)
- Protect against no WebGL!
- Implement testing!!! Coverage etc
- Sort of errorhandler in XtkView - display error message with bad load!
- Fix updating of LOOKUP for 3D VIEW - thought this was working!?
- NEED MORE ACCURATE FEEDBACK ON THE ACTUAL DATA?


DONE:

- USE FASTER ZOOM FOR 2D CANVASES
- Implemenent F-Button to reset!
- FIX MOUSE BEHAVIOUR WHEN ROTATING AND LEAVING THE SCREEN
- Work on Annotations - See below
- Work on overlaying of label maps!!!!? BIG ISSUE POTENTIALLY

===================================================================================

Upload website to my webspace

- compile XTK!
- IT's ALIVE!!!!
- FIX THE LABELMAP CODE FOR ONLINE












====================================================================================

LABELMAPS:
----------

	1.) design interface for Labelmap
	    - DONE!

	2.) test how color lookups affect the label map?
	    - should be okay since on different buffer
	    - DONE!

	3.) Figure out local file loading! - DONE

	4.) Figure out 
	    - transparancy
	    - visibility
	    - file name in label
	    DONE!
	    
	5.) implement adding this to volume on the fly
	    should be able to reuse code from colortable lookup!
 	    DONE!

	    --------


	6.) FIGURE OUT HOW 3D LABELMAP IS APPLIED!!!

	6.) Reloading of file/Deleting of file

	7.) - check annotations
	    - figure out bad file load! what happens, when, why?






ANNOTATIONS:
------------

Plan:

	- check if visual updating can happen faster, simultaneous in
          all renderers? - SEEMS TRICKY, ASK BEN
	- modifiers in 3D view? DIFFICULT, NOT WORTH IT?
	- think about custom shapes? (sphere?) DIFFICULT?
	  - eg Sphere...
	    - how to edit? Scaling only? Or control points?
	    
	-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	DONE:
	- improved hover look for manips
	- add visibility toggle to annotation class
	- refine multiple loading of files?
	- track down error when deleting/turning invisible!
	- set correct annos when switching layer
	- fixed annoying bug with 3D View when loading a new layer item 
	- fix collapsed verts!
	- refactored, got rid of manipulators, Point2D now separate class!
	- clean up functions in 3DcanvasViewer
	- fix offsetting box when making tiny change!
	- have layer light up when selected in the viewer?

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	THINGS TO LOOK INTO LATER:
	- anyway to improve performance when navigating?
	  - ASK Ben, check if possible to embed the annotation into
	    the volume object   
	- improve point sorting for cube!




====================================================================================

DONE:
-----
- work on brightness!
- Fix Layout Swapping
- Cap indices when middle-mouse scrolling
- Fixed a redundancy in the code re update function, was being called
- multiple times!
- WHEN DELETING LAYER, FOCUS BACK ON THE FIRST ONE
- fix overlay (file undefined)
- fix levels sliders
- fix scroll behaviour when no valid items are set!
- add textEdit field for selectedIndex
- add in correction for input fields in Levels (for wrong inputs)
- Fix Buffer selection
- separate out 2D and 3DCanvasViewer	
- Restore 3D Functionality (pan/zoom/rotate)
- Volume Rendering done



NEXT STEPS:
-----------

- Add warning window when not able to load file
  - COMPLEX, LEAVE THIS SHIT TIL LATER, NEED TO DEBUG THOROUGHLY
  - should I only support NII for now?
  - Test script
      - would need a file loader
      - would need the whole loading malarchy


  
    


- Work on overlaying of label maps

- Tutorials? Guide?





CBB's:
------

- Revise interaction of panels, bring up to XTK-style quality!
