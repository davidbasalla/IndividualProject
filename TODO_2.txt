TODAY:

work on:
    - performance issue!! - how to reduce? POTENTIALLY HUGE PROBLEM
    - could only have 1 view active...
        - how to determine the time frame
        - need all 4 views active when changing global parameters (eg opacity)
    - only update the render after XTK renderer has finished drawing... need
      to have a callback for when XTKrenderer has changed?



    - colortables











WIP:

- add different lookups
- work on refining the layout
	- make canvas fit inside the canv panel!!
	- fix resizing!




--------------------------------------

- work on customisable layout
    - determine screen layout

- work on implementing lookups!
    - for viewer or for layer
    - for viewer more desirable!

- work on providing online sample files

- add navigation panel feedback


---------------------------------------


- add extra controls
    - pan (2D)
    - zoom (2D)
    - shift control to control other slices!

    - simlulate a mouse click on the xtk canvas element... 
    - alter the volume's data directly... prefered!
