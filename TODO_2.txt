TODO:
-----


HIGH PRIORITY:

- implement annotation!!! SEE BELOW

- WORK ON SMOOTHER INTERACTION - MOUSE-BASED... currently very slow, 
  compared to XTK navigation

- hook up mouse keys in Chrome!!
- talk to Ben Glocker about color lookups, when brightness is being applied
- FIX THE AUTOSCALING WHEN SWITCHING VIEWS


LOW PRIORITY:

- make custom slider for brightness/threshold
- work on providing online sample files
- add navigation panel feedback (for setting camera specifically)
- work on brightness!
- Protect against no WebGL
- Implement testing!!! Coverage etc
- Sort of errorhandler in XtkView
- Fix updating of LOOKUP for 3D VIEW - thought this was working!?



ANNOTATIONS:
------------

- decide on format - XML

Plan:
	1.)
	- create a dummy file with a sample cube and label
	- create temp interface to load annotation file
	- load and view this file in the viewer

	- loader
	  - use loader, read XML as string, then do stuff with it
	    (DONE)
	  - renderer, now ready to interpret the annotation
	  - need to translate the points into WORLD SPACE?
	  - investigate!

	2.)
	- enable the other 2D viewers	
	  - deal with navigation
	  - okay, but little bit hacky, as in unresponsive		
	- add text (determine text coordinate)
	  - various options for placing the text, test thoroughly
	- enable color change

	- look into 3D viewer notation?
	  - involved
	    - use cubes... wireframe render?
	    - need to be able to add cube on the fly. add support for this...


	3.)	  
	- Switch XML to JSON

	- layer management for annotations
	  - annotations should be:
	    - selectable		       	  
	    - set visibility
	    - deletable
	    - loadable
	    - editable

	    - PLAN:
	      - delete Layer
	      - edit Label name
	      - edit color






	4.)
	- enable modification of notation - hovering - TRICKY!!
	- implement modification of class
	- implement saving out of document (XML, JSON)


	5.) - CLEANUP
	- update display when traversing
	- be able to remove cubes when turning annotations on and off!

	-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	THINGS TO LOOK INTO LATER:
	- anyway to improve performance when navigating?
	- rescale text when zooming?
	- improve point sorting for cube!
	- be able to remove cubes when turning annotations on and off!







====================================================================================

DONE:
-----
- work on brightness!
- Fix Layout Swapping
- Cap indices when middle-mouse scrolling
- Fixed a redundancy in the code re update function, was being called
- multiple times!
- WHEN DELETING LAYER, FOCUS BACK ON THE FIRST ONE
- fix overlay (file undefined)
- fix levels sliders
- fix scroll behaviour when no valid items are set!
- add textEdit field for selectedIndex
- add in correction for input fields in Levels (for wrong inputs)
- Fix Buffer selection
- separate out 2D and 3DCanvasViewer	
- Restore 3D Functionality (pan/zoom/rotate)
- Volume Rendering done



NEXT STEPS:
-----------

- Add warning window when not able to load file
  - COMPLEX, LEAVE THIS SHIT TIL LATER, NEED TO DEBUG THOROUGHLY
  - should I only support NII for now?
  - Test script
      - would need a file loader
      - would need the whole loading malarchy


  
    


- Build custom slider to slider around for window level and threshold

- Work on overlaying of label maps

- Tutorials? Guide?





CBB's:
------

- Revise interaction of panels, bring up to XTK-style quality!
