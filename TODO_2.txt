TODO:
-----


HIGH PRIORITY:

- Work on Annotations - See below
- WORK ON SMOOTHER INTERACTION - MOUSE-BASED... currently very slow, 
  compared to XTK navigation - seems to be down to how many times the
  screen is updated
- talk to Ben Glocker about color lookups, when brightness is being applied
- FIX THE AUTOSCALING WHEN SWITCHING VIEWS
- COUNTERACT SCALING OF ELEMENTS (LAYERS/ANNOS) - Have layout options?
- WORK ON LAYOUT


LOW PRIORITY:

- fix 3DCanvas mouse behaviour
- create hotkeys for everything?
- make custom slider for brightness/threshold
- work on providing online sample files
- add navigation panel feedback (for setting camera specifically)
- work on brightness!
- Protect against no WebGL
- Implement testing!!! Coverage etc
- Sort of errorhandler in XtkView
- Fix updating of LOOKUP for 3D VIEW - thought this was working!?
- NEED MORE FEEDBACK ON THE ACTUAL DATA?



ANNOTATIONS:
------------

Plan:

	- check if visual updating can happen faster, simultaneous in
          all renderers?
	  - for 3D, would need to change the transform of the cube!
	- modifiers in 3D view? DIFFICULT, NOT WORTH IT?
	- fix offsetting box when making tiny change!
	  - still working on this, need to check scaling offset!

	- think about custom shapes? (sphere?)
	- have layer light up when selected in the viewer?
	- clean up functions in 3DcanvasViewer


	-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	DONE:
	- improved hover look for manips
	- add visibility toggle to annotation class
	- refine multiple loading of files?
	- track down error when deleting/turning invisible!
	- set correct annos when switching layer
	- fixed annoying bug with 3D View when loading a new layer item 
	- fix collapsed verts!
	- refactored, got rid of manipulators, Point2D now separate class!


	-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	THINGS TO LOOK INTO LATER:
	- anyway to improve performance when navigating?
	- rescale text when zooming?
	- improve point sorting for cube!











====================================================================================

DONE:
-----
- work on brightness!
- Fix Layout Swapping
- Cap indices when middle-mouse scrolling
- Fixed a redundancy in the code re update function, was being called
- multiple times!
- WHEN DELETING LAYER, FOCUS BACK ON THE FIRST ONE
- fix overlay (file undefined)
- fix levels sliders
- fix scroll behaviour when no valid items are set!
- add textEdit field for selectedIndex
- add in correction for input fields in Levels (for wrong inputs)
- Fix Buffer selection
- separate out 2D and 3DCanvasViewer	
- Restore 3D Functionality (pan/zoom/rotate)
- Volume Rendering done



NEXT STEPS:
-----------

- Add warning window when not able to load file
  - COMPLEX, LEAVE THIS SHIT TIL LATER, NEED TO DEBUG THOROUGHLY
  - should I only support NII for now?
  - Test script
      - would need a file loader
      - would need the whole loading malarchy


  
    


- Build custom slider to slider around for window level and threshold

- Work on overlaying of label maps

- Tutorials? Guide?





CBB's:
------

- Revise interaction of panels, bring up to XTK-style quality!
