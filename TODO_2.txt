WIP:

    - work on customisable layout
        - presets
        - splitters
    - add extra buttons/toggles/modes
    - work on opac slider?
    - add label maps
    - work on temporary canvas, make stuff customisable
    - split out canvasViews into 2D and 3D, add custom panels
        - 3D - has volume rendering
             - has no index slider
        - 2D - has index slider
             - can do merging with other canvas
    - use model Cids to keep track of objects??



DONE:
    - work on brightness/levels DONE





Having viewer canvas that copy the XTK views
Pros:
    - can add my own overlays
    - can do sliding/comparisons
    - can add custom interactors
    - can hide internal handling of files mess from user (have custom load bar)
    - allows to have more modular structure with one-time viewers on front-end

Cons:
    - have to copy various controls
    - possible slow down??


Controls to overwrite
    2D:
        - manipulating slices with shift-click-over
        - sliceIndex (slider and middle mouse) - NO PROBLEM
    3D:
        - 3D controls - could work - NEED TO TEST
