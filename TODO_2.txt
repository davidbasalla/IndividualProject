TODAY:

- Colortables:
  - problematic
      - XTK does not support applying ColorTable to loaded file
      - XTK only supports ColorTables for labelmaps
      -	have managed to apply color lookup to one slice only, need to
        delve deeper

      - also application of colormaps happens at the beginning when
        parsing the file structure, so not clear how interactive the
	swapping of files would be... NEED TO TEST

	Next steps:
	- get colorTables working for actual files
	- talk to Ben about importance of this feature
	- requires separate loading of these maps?
	- need to fully understand the flow of control of Xtk
	  
    
     


WIP:

- add different lookups
- work on refining the layout
	- make canvas fit inside the canv panel!!
	- fix resizing!




--------------------------------------

- work on customisable layout
    - determine screen layout

- work on implementing lookups!
    - for viewer or for layer
    - for viewer more desirable!

- work on providing online sample files

- add navigation panel feedback


---------------------------------------


- add extra controls
    - pan (2D)
    - zoom (2D)
    - shift control to control other slices!

PAN:
    - simlulate a mouse click on the xtk canvas element... 
    - alter the volume's data directly... prefered!
